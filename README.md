This repo takes data from a CSV file held in my local machine (omitted for privacy precautions) and attempts to get business insights from someones company name and job title. 

Those insights are their job function (ie engineer), department (ie IT) and seniority (ie Senior).

So far this script performs a simple search of the job title and using keyword search extracts relevant information if it is there.
